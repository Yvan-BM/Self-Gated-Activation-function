# Self-Gated-Activation-function
Implementation of Self-Gated Activation function with Resnet32 train on CIFAR10 dataset.

This github uses a modified version of the code from [pytorch_resnet_cifar10](https://github.com/akamaster/pytorch_resnet_cifar10) that is an implementation of resnet on CIFAR10 dataset.

Here we use this implementation to test the activation function Swish.
